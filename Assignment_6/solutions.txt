Problem 2 

The code should look like this without forwarding:

addl %edx, %eax
mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edx
nop
nop
nop
addl %edx, %eax

There should be 3 nops as the first addl will have hit it's Write-back and the mrmovl will be hitting it's Write-back as the second addl hits it's decode

The code should look like this with forwarding:

addl %edx, %eax
mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edx
bubble
addl %edx, %eax

There should be 1 bubble as the first addl will have hit it's Write-back and the mrmovl will be hitting it's Write-back as the second addl hits it's decode
